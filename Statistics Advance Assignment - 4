Q1: What is the difference between a t-test and a z-test? Provide an example scenario where you would use each type of test.
Ans. The main difference between z-test and t-test is when sample size is large (>=30) and standard deviation is known, we use z-test and when sample size is small (30>) and standard deviation is unknown we use t-test.
Suppose we want to test whether there is a difference in the mean weight of two groups of people:men and women. We can use t-test to compare mean weight of men and women if sample size is less than 30 and z-test when sample size is greater than 30 and standard deviation is known.

Q2: Differentiate between one-tailed and two-tailed tests.
A one-tailed test is a statistical test in which critical area of distribution is one-sided so that it is greater or smaller than a certain value, but not both.
A two-tailed test is a statistical test in which the critical area of distribution is two-sided and test whether the sample is greater than or less than a certain range of values.

Q3: Explain the concept of Type 1 and Type 2 errors in hypothesis testing. Provide an example scenario for each type of error.
Ans. In hypothesis testing, type 1 error occurs when null is rejected but it is actually true. Type 2 error occurs when null hypothesis is not rejected but it is actually false
Examples: Suppose, in medical testing, a patient is diagnosed with a disease but actually he or she is healthy. In this case it is a Type 1 error. And if a patient is found to be healthy but actually he or she has some disease then it is a type 2 error.

Q4: Explain Bayes's theorem with an example.
Ans. Bayes's theorem describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to an event.
Lets take an example of a toy manufacturing company. Machines A1,A2 and A3 produced 25%,35% and 40% of toys respectively. Out of these 5%, 4% and 2% found to be defective. Then to find the probability that a toy was manufactured by machine A2, when selected at random, we use Bayes's theorem.

Q5: What is a confidence interval? How to calculate the confidence interval, explain with an example.
Ans. A confidence interval is a range between which a true value exists with a certain level of confidence.To calculate the confidence interval first we have to calculate standard error by dividing standard deviation by root of sample size and then calculate the z-value or t-value
lower_ci=mean-(t-value or z-value * standard error)
upper_ci=mean+(t-value or z-value * standard error)
Example: A random sample of heights of students taken from a population (n=50). The sample mean is 165 cm and standard deviation is 8. We want to calculate the 95% confidence interval for true average of heights of students.
Standard error=std/sqrt(50)=8/sqrt(50)=1.13
alpha=0.5
z-value=1.96
upper_ci=165+(1.96 * 1.13)=167.2148
lower_ci=165-(1.96 * 1.13)=162.7965
(162.7965,162.2148)

Q6. Use Bayes's Theorem to calculate the probability of an event occurring given prior knowledge of the event's probability and new evidence. Provide a sample problem and solution.
Ans. Machines A1,A2 and A3 produced 25%,35% and 40% of toys respectively. Out of these 5%, 4% and 2% found to be defective. Then to find the probability that a toy was manufactured by machine A2, when selected at random, we use Bayes's theorem.
Pr(A1 that car manufactured from machine A1)=25%=0.25
Pr(A2 that car manufactured from machine A2)=35%=0.35
Pr(A3 that car manufactured from machine A3)=40%=0.40
Let B be the probability that a toy selected is defective
Pr(B/A1 the defective toy was from machine A1)=5%=0.05
Pr(B/A2 the defective toy was from machine A2)=4%=0.04
Pr(B/A3 the defective toy was from machine A3)=2%=0.02
We have to find pr(A2/B)
Pr(A2/B)=(Pr(A2)* P(B/A2))/(P(A1)* P(B/A1))+(P(A2)* P(B/A2))+(P(A2)* P(B/A1))

P_A1,P_A2,P_A3=0.25,0.35,0.40
P_B_A1,P_B_A2,P_B_A3=0.05,0.04,0.02
P_A2_B=(P_A2*P_B_A2)/((P_A1*P_B_A1)+(P_A2*P_B_A2)+(P_A3*P_B_A3))
print("The probability that a defective toy is from machine A2 is ",P_A2_B)
The probability that a defective toy is from machine A2 is  0.4057971014492753
Q7. Calculate the 95% confidence interval for a sample of data with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 5. Interpret the results.
Ans. Sample size is not given so we assume sample size to 30
Since sample size is large and standard deviation is given, we'll use z-test

import numpy as np
alpha=0.05
mean=50
std=5
critical_value=1.96
standard_error=std/np.sqrt(30)
upper_ci=mean+(critical_value*standard_error)
lower_ci=mean-(critical_value*standard_error)
print(f"The confidence interval is {lower_ci,upper_ci}")
The confidence interval is (48.21077297881646, 51.78922702118354)
We are 95% confident that the true mean will be between range(48.21,51.78)

Q8. What is the margin of error in a confidence interval? How does sample size affect the margin of error? Provide an example of a scenario where a larger sample size would result in a smaller margin of error.
Ans. Margin of error in confidence interval is the range of values between which a true population parameter is likely to fall. The relationship between margin of error and sample size is as sample size increases, the margin of error decreases.
Suppose a professor wants to calculate the 95% confidence interval of height of 100 students with mean height of 165 cm and standard deviation of 1. Then the margin of error would be:
critical value(std/sqrt(100))=1.96(1/sqrt(100))=0.0196
Now let's take sample size as 600
1.96*(1/sqrt(600))=0.0032
As you can see, when sample size is 100, the margin of error was 0.0196 and when we increase sample size to 600, the margin of error decreased to 0.0032

Q9. Calculate the z-score for a data point with a value of 75, a population mean of 70, and a population standard deviation of 5. Interpret the results.

data_point=75
mean=70
std=5
z_score=(data_point-mean)/std
print("The z-score is ",z_score)
The z-score is  1.0
Interpretation: A z_score of zero means that the data point is one standard deviation away from the mean

Q10. In a study of the effectiveness of a new weight loss drug, a sample of 50 participants lost an average of 6 pounds with a standard deviation of 2.5 pounds. Conduct a hypothesis test to determine if the drug is significantly effective at a 95% confidence level using a t-test.

Null Hypothesis: The mean weight loss of population is zero
Alternate hypothesis: The mean weight loss is greater than zero
It is a one tail test
If t-stats is greater than t-value, we will reject the null hypothesis

t-stats: 16.970562748477143
t_value: -1.6765508919142635
We reject null hypothesis
Conclusion: The drug is found to be significantly effective at 95% confidence interval
Q11. In a survey of 500 people, 65% reported being satisfied with their current job. Calculate the 95% confidence interval for the true proportion of people who are satisfied with their job.

In this we have to calculate confidence interval for proportion.
Formula p+-z * sqrt(p(1-p)/n)
p=sample proportion=0.65

from scipy.stats import norm
p=0.65
n=500
z_value=(norm.ppf(alpha/2))

c2=p+(z_value*np.sqrt((p*(1-p))/n))
print(f"We are 95% confident that the true proportionof people who are\nsatisfied with their jobs lies between ({c2},{c1})")
We are 95% confident that the true proportionof people who are
satisfied with their jobs lies between (0.6081925393809212,0.6918074606190788)
